1. Select the make_name and model_name of all vehicles, regardless of whether they are on the lot or not, which have a first production year of 1986.

π make_name, model_name (
	σ first_production_year = '1986' (
		((Vehicle) ⨝ Vehicle.fk_model_id = Model.model_id (Model)) 
				   ⨝ Vehicle.fk_make_id = Make.make_id (Make))
)



2. Select the make_name and model_name of all vehicles with the color name “Sky Blue”
and which are on the lot.

π make_name, model_name (
	σ name = 'Sky Blue' (
		((((Vehicle) ⨝ Vehicle.vehicle_id = Inventory.fk_vehicle_id (Inventory)) 
					 ⨝ Inventory.fk_color_id = Color.color_id (Color))
					 ⨝ Vehicle.fk_make_id = Make.make_id (Make))
					 ⨝ Vehicle.fk_model_id = Model.model_id (Model))
)




3. Select the make_name, model_name and incentive amount for all vehicles on the lot with an incentive type “dealer”.

π make_name, model_name (
	σ type = 'dealer' (
		(((((Vehicle) ⨝ Vehicle.vehicle_id = Inventory.fk_vehicle_id (Inventory)) 
					  ⨝ Vehicle.vehicle_id = Vehicle_Incentive.fk_vehicle_id (Vehicle_Incentive))
					  ⨝ Vehicle_Incentive.fk_incentive_id = Incentive.incentive_id (Incentive))
					  ⨝ Vehicle.fk_make_id = Make.make_id (Make))
					  ⨝ Vehicle.fk_model_id = Model.model_id (Model))
)

4. Convert the following query to relational algebra
	SELECT Player.id, Team.name, City.name FROM Player
	INNER JOIN Team ON Player.team_id = Team.id
	INNER JOIN City ON Team.city_id = City.id
	WHERE Player.score = 100;

π Player.id, Team.name, City.name (
	σ Player.score = 100 (
		((Player) ⨝ Player.team_id = Team.id (Team)) 
				  ⨝ Team.city_id = City.id (City))
)


5. For problem 3 above, convert your relational algebra query into a SQL query
SELECT Make.make_name, Model.model_id FROM Vehicle
INNER JOIN Inventory ON Vehicle.vehicle_id = Inventory.fk_vehicle_id
INNER JOIN Vehicle_Incentive ON Vehicle.vehicle_id = Vehicle_Incentive.fk_vehicle_id
INNER JOIN Incentive ON Vehicle_Incentive.fk_incentive_id = Incentive.incentive_id
INNER JOIN Make ON Vehicle.fk_make_id = Make.make_id
INNER JOIN Model ON Vehicle.fk_model_id = Model.model_id
WHERE Incentive.type = 'dealer'
